### Installation

##### Using [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/)

+ Open the command palette (`CTRL+SHIFT+P` or `CMD+SHIFT+P`).
+ Find `Package Control: Install Package`.
+ Search for `Haft Lang`

##### Manual

+ Copy repo to the `Packages/` directory.
+ Restart Sublime Text after installing themes is a good idea.

### Activating theme

Activate the theme by configuring the `theme` setting in your user preferences:

    "theme": "HaftLang.sublime-theme",


### Theme

Haft Lang is inspired by the [Devastate](https://github.com/vlakarados/devastate) theme by [Sergey Telshevsky](https://github.com/vlakarados). Haft Lang tries to be even more minimal and clutter-free than the already super minimal Devastate. It's just you and your code/text.


### Color scheme

Haft Lang ships with [Tomorrow Night Bright](https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme) and [Base16 Bright Dark](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#bright) by [Chris Kempson](http://chriskempson.com).

To use one of the themes just configure the `color_scheme` setting:

    "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Haft Lang/Tomorrow-Night-Bright.tmTheme"

or

    "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Haft Lang/base16-bright.dark.tmTheme"
